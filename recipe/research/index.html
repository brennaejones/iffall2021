            <h2>Recipe Website References</h2>
            <h3>https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/peanut-butter-desserts/</h3>
            <p>This recipe website works well because it functions as a slideshow. Viewers can click through to browse pictures of the recipes as well as short descriptions, then click for more info if they want. There’s also a section lower on the page that has all the slideshow contents laid out for easy access.</p>
            <h3>https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes</h3>
            <p>This site is also very effective because it has all kinds of topics that would help the viewer navigate. The recipes are categorized based on criteria such as “ways to use ground beef” or “meals under 30 minutes.” There’s also a clear hierarchy that encourages perusing of the rest of the site.</p>
            <h3>https://food52.com/recipes</h3>
            <p>This website is super trendy and fun to look at. The layout is very clean and there are lots of images of the food. There are also cute, enticing headings such as “Get Saucy” that keep the viewer engaged.</p>

            <h2>Other Website References</h2>
            <h3>https://simplychocolate.dk/</h3>
            <p>This website has super cool design elements I can incorporate such as bold colors, a very clear layout, and lots of negative space to let the information breathe. I really enjoy how the foreground and background work together, making the whole thing feel like one cohesive whole. The text alignment is also very interesting.</p>
            <h3>https://koox.co.uk/</h3>
            <p>Much like the first example, this site is very interactive and fun to experience. The use of simple but bold typefaces clarifies the detailed imagery, and the color scheme is inviting and fits the concept of "juice pharmacy." I also enjoy how the page itself doesn't scroll; all the information you need is either in the bar at the top or the vertical slideshow.</p>
            <h3>https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/</h3>
            <p>The final example I found is packed full of information, but it's laid out in such a way to be very manageable for the viewer. The designer embraced a tetris-like grid that moves well. The color scheme also works very well and makes for a fun viewing experience.</p>

            <h2>Reference Images</h2>
            <p>I chose these images because I'm planning on hand-drawing food doodles for my website. I want them to be black and white with simple, bold lines to offset all the text.</p>

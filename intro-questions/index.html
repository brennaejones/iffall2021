        <h1>Intro Questions!</h1>
        <h2>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h2>
        <p>My name is Brenna Jones, my majors are communication design & drama, and I am a junior!</p>
        <h2>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h2>
        <p>I have been on the com des track since freshman year, but my artistic background is primarily analog. I am new to the digital world, so I’m excited to become more comfortable with design in a digital format. I am also here to fulfill the major requirement.</p>
        <h2>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
        <p>I don’t really have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS. In my freshman digital studio course, we briefly touched on it, so I know what it looks like when I see it, but I have no experience interacting with it. </p>
        <h2>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
        <p>In this class, I hope to gain a better understanding of web design as a process. Right now, there’s a complete disconnect in my brain between how I turn my drawings/logos into websites that viewers can actually interact with. I have no knowledge of turning static images/components into buttons or headings or things that people can click on and move and interact with.</p>
        <h2>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
        <p>I think designing for screen will be different from designing on paper simply because it’s not all coming straight from me and my brain. Instead of saying “I want this to look like this” and drawing it, I will have to say “I want this to look like this, and this is how I communicate that to my machine.” There’s now a whole other second brain involved.</p>
        <h2>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
        <p>A website I think exemplifies effective design is: http://www.distancetomars.com/. This website is super fun and aligns with some of the stylistic trends I enjoy such as minimalism and simple, more muted colors. While there isn’t much content on the page, the design is effective because it fully supports the content in an engaging and beautiful way.</p>
        <h2>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
        <p>A website I think exemplifies effective communication is: https://camposcoffee.com/. I chose this one because it’s very simple and clean; the viewer doesn’t have to wade through muddled information. Everything is sectioned off and clear, and importance is denoted by bolder, larger typefaces. Pictures are used sparingly and with stylistic purpose. The website goes from top to bottom and has a clear bar at the top with the extra pages. </p>
        <h2>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
        <p>A website I think works well is: https://intothetrenches.1917.movie/. This is a site I stumbled upon, and it’s a promotion for the movie 1917. It works well because it basically works like a video game: the viewer can navigate the trenches and click on storyboards and videos. Everything runs very smoothly, and I didn’t encounter any glitches or bugs. The trenches are three-dimensional and active, and it seems like a lot of work went into refining it. </p>
